We have been give the map and the sensor readings from a LIDAR and odometrysensor to localize a robot in a given environment.  So the state at any given timetis defined by the pose of the robotxt= (x,y,Î¸).  These three parameters completelyrepresent the state of the robot in a given 2D Map of the Wean Hall at CMU. We used a particle filter to approach this problem.
